1.  Introduction


2.  Terminology

   This document inherits JSON Web Algorithms (JWA)-related terminology
   from [JOSE-JWA], JSON Web Encryption (JWE)-related terminology from
   [JOSE-JWE], and JSON Web Key (JWK)-related terminology from
   [JOSE-JWK].  Security-related terms are to be understood in the sense
   defined in [RFC4949].

   The capitalized key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL",
   "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   [RFC2119].
